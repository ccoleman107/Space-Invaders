# Space-Invaders
Description:
For my final project I attempted to make a space inavders like game as it is a classic game with pretty simple mechanics. In the game you have your player along the bottom X axis that you control, and you attempt to shoot enemies at the top of the screen. Once you eliminate all of them you will win the game.
I was not able to complete a couple things as I could not figure out how to properly incorporate it. First the collsion between lasers and enemies is incomplete. For this reason the player is unable to see the You Win display as the enemies cannot be hidde. The code is commented on the sketch but not apart of it since it was not working. I was not able to add in any if the libraires for sounds and gameplay as well. I worked by myself for the project which proved difficult sometimes trying to solve any bugs.
